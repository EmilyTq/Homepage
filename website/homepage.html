    <p>  I'm an undergrad at LACCD with hopes of becoming a paralegal. I've worked as an administrative assistant, <br>
        at a non profit immigration firm, where I realized that along with my personal history <br>
        I have great passion for helping communities fight the injustices of the immigration<br>
        system. On my free time, I enjoy reading manga, poetry and fictional books. <p>
